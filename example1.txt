Purpose / Context
Putting it together, this line is probably being used to choose which data points will be considered anomalies (i.e. “anomalous”) in a dataset of size num_samples:
You have num_samples total points.
You decide that 5% of them should be anomalies.
So you randomly select that many distinct indices.
Then elsewhere in the code these indices might be used to mark or treat those data points differently (e.g. add noise, label them anomalous, etc.).
